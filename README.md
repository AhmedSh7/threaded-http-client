🔹 1. Create README.md

In your project folder (~/PycharmProjects/DDOS), create a file named README.md with this content:

# Threaded HTTP Client (Safe Localhost Test)

This project is inspired by the *Network Programming with Python* tutorial.  
It demonstrates how to use **Python sockets and threading** to send multiple concurrent requests to a local HTTP server.

⚠️ **Note:** This client is **only for testing against your own localhost server** (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`).  
It is not intended for real DoS/DDoS use.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Start a local HTTP server in the project folder:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1


Run the threaded client:

python main.py --threads 10 --duration 5


Example output:

500
1000
...
Done. Successful requests: 10182
Elapsed: 5.01s | Approx. 2032.8 req/s | Threads: 10 | Target: 127.0.0.1:8000

🔧 CLI Options

--target (default 127.0.0.1)

--port (default 8000)

--threads (default 10)

--duration seconds (default 5, use 0 to run until Ctrl+C)

--sleep delay between requests (default 0.003)

📚 Concepts Learned

Python socket programming

Multi-threading with threading.Thread

Simple load-testing against a local server

Command-line interfaces with argparse

✅ Example Use Case

Educational demonstration for network programming

Safe practice for concurrency and client/server design

It's for a resume project for showcasing Python + networking skills
